# ludo

## Description

Ludo is a multi-player board game that takes a combination of luck and skill to win! To win the game, a player needs to be the first to get all four of their tokens to the winning tile.

This game uses Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3.

## Approach

* Wireframes were created and used as a guide to complete HTML and CSS components for game. HTML and CSS were used to created the DOM elements for the game and to style these elements, respectively.

* DOM manipulation and game logic were implemented simultaneously in an iterative process. HTML and CSS were revised as needed to preserve style during this process.
  * Logic for the game overall was broken down to smaller pieces (start logic, play logic, change turn logic, move logic, win logic, score logic, etc.).
  * Consider how to write each function using DRY code (eg. utilized a class to create token objects and functions, used functions/loops to apply repeating tasks).
  * Each piece was tackled using a function or series of functions.
     * Used MDN, jQuery, W3schools to learn new methods or about built in functions.
  * Errors in logic were detected by playing the game and utilizing console.log and other development tools.
  * Revise each function and make DRY.
  * Commit after each iteration and completion of piece of logic that passed testing.

* A complete revision of code was done to remove any useless lines of code, remaining console.log lines, any unused variables, and any lingering comments as well as to format code to ensure readability. Final touches made to HTML and CSS files of the fully functional game.

* The `readme.md` file was edited to summarize process.

## Further Goals

This ludo game is fully functional and can be reset using the RESET button in the game. Still, this game can be improved by allowing a two-player mode and a player vs. AI mode. In addition, additional features like allowing the user to input player names and music or sounds can add to the appeal of the game. If given more time, these features would have been incorporated.
